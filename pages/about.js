                various fields. The department have faculty members and
                supported laboratories in the followng fields: 1) Operations
                Research in Production Planning 2) Advanced manufacturing
                processes and materials 3) Automation and robotics 4) Quality in
                production systems 5) Logistics and supply chain management 6)
                Human factor 7) Environmental assessment and green production 8)
                Healthcare Engineering. The department encourage active learning
                style and using 21st century learning methods in various kinds
                for enhancing student learning. Students can select cooperative
                program that students work at the real factory domestically and

                and/or productivity improvement projects at real manufactuirng
                factories under supervision of professors in our department. The
                student must demonstrate critical thinking skills, communication
                skills and Engineering technical skills through senior project
                examinations. For graduate study, the department provides 3
                master programs: 1) Industrial Engineering 2) Logistics
                Engineering and supply chain management 3) Industrial Management
                and 1 Ph.D. program in Industrial Engineering. The graduate
                students involve in industry research problems and several
                funding institutues' grants.
